# FastStack

# Version 1.6.0 - March 6, 2026
# By Alan Rockefeller

Ultra-fast, caching JPG viewer designed for culling and selecting RAW or JPG files for focus stacking and website upload.

This tool is optimized for speed, using `libjpeg-turbo` for decoding, aggressive prefetching, and byte-aware LRU caches to provide a fluid experience when reviewing thousands of images.

## Features

- **Crop:** Added the ability to crop and rotate images via the cr(O)p hotkey (or right mouse click).   It can be a freeform crop, or constrained to several popular aspect ratios.
- **Zoom & Pan:** Smooth zooming and panning.
- **Stack Selection:** Group images into stacks (`[`, `]`) and select them for processing (`S`).
- **Spark Line**: In grid view, a spark line is visible on each folder, so you can see how far you have gotten in uploading photos in each directory.
- **Helicon Focus Integration:** Launch Helicon Focus with your selected RAW files with a single keypress (`Enter`).
- **Instant Navigation:** Sub-10ms next/previous image switching, high performance decoding via `PyTurboJPEG`.
- **Image Editor:** Built-in editor with exposure, contrast, white balance, sharpness, and more (E key)
- **Quick Auto White Balance:** Press A to apply auto white balance and save automatically with undo support (Ctrl+Z).   For better white balance, load the raw into Photoshop with the P key.- **Photoshop Integration:** Edit current image in Photoshop (P key) - always uses RAW files when available.
- **Clipboard Support:** Copy image path to clipboard (Ctrl+C)
- **Image Filtering:** Filter images by filename
- **Drag & Drop:** Drag images to external applications.   Press { and } to batch files to drag & drop multiple images.
- **Theme Support:** Toggle between light and dark themes
- **Delete & Undo:** Move images to recycle bin (Delete/Backspace) with undo support (Ctrl+Z)
- **Has Memory:** Starts where you left off, tells you which images have been edited, stacked and uploaded.
- **RAW Pairing:** Automatically maps JPGs to their corresponding RAW files (`.CR3`, `.ARW`, `.NEF`, etc.).
- **Configurable:** Adjust cache sizes, prefetch behavior, and Helicon Focus / Photoshop paths via a settings dialog and a persistent `.ini` file.
- **Accurate Colors:** Uses monitor ICC profile to display colors correctly.
- **RGB Histogram:** Pressing H brings up a RGB histogram which is designed to show even a little bit of highlight clipping and updates as you zoom in.
- **Full Screen Mode:** Pressing F11 enters full screen mode - Esc/F11 exits.

## Installation

### macOS (Recommended)
FastStack performs best on Python 3.12 due to PySide6 compatibility.

1.  **Install Python 3.12 (via Homebrew):**
    ```bash
    brew install python@3.12
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python3.12 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install FastStack:**
    ```bash
    # From source directory
    python -m pip install -U pip
    python -m pip install .
    ```
    *Note: If you encounter issues with `opencv-python` or `PySide6` on newer Python versions (3.13+), please stick to Python 3.12.*

4.  **Run:**
    ```bash
    faststack
    ```

### Windows / Linux
```bash
python -m venv venv
# Activate venv (Windows: venv\Scripts\activate, Linux: source venv/bin/activate)
pip install .
faststack
```
